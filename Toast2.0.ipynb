    "\n",
    "The basic problem is this. When toast teeters off the edge of a standard counter it seems to, remarkably consistently, land 'jelly side' down. I have read that this is no accident and that in fact the solution to the problem is to push the toast when you notice it going off the edge rather than try to stop it. I have done some loose experiments and find this to be empirically true. You should try it yourself and you can use a book if you don't want to waste a piece of toast. Now -- can I use basic dynamics and an numerical approach to explore this problem without getting caught up the analytic solution to the problem documented in various places in AJP. "

    "Something we often don't get to in PH211 is the rotational version of Newton's Laws. This will come up in ENGR 211 (Statics) and historically students make the transition pretty successfully. The core concept is that linear forces and rotational forces (torques) act independently to determine the behavior of an object. Point masses that we talked about most of the time in PH211 have no physical size so you can't rotate them. Toast on the other hand does have physical size and so we must consider both linear and rotational motion. The 30 second lecture about this is that every linear variable we discussed (x, v, and a and the components of each in the i,j, and k directions) has an angular equivalent. This table summarizes those equivalents:\n",
