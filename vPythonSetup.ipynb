    "\n",
    "At this time (10/20) vPython appears to be compatible with verisons of Jupyterlab through 1.2.6. You may need to remove your current install of Jupyterlab to do this. To install specific versions of Jupyterlab (and remove the application) go to the settings icon in the top right corner of the Jupyterlab frame on the Home tab in Anaconda Navigator.\n",

    "The most effective instructions I have found for installing vpython in a Jupyterlab environment are [here - thanks to Bruce Sherwood](https://www.vpython.org/presentation2018/install.html). Here are the principle steps in that process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparation: Launch Juypterlab from Anaconda Navigator which should open a window in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "i: Update python by going to the Environments tab on Anaconda Navigator. Choose to display the Installed environments and scroll down to find your python package. To the right is a column which indicates the version number. If there is a blue arrow there indicating an update to the package you can click to install. At the time of this document my python version was 3.8.3.\n",

    "\n",
    "![github menu](images/terminalwindow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "iii: In that terminal window you will execute the following commands (from the document linked above). Anaconda will sort out what needs to be installed and updated. For the two installs it will ask you if you want to proceed at some point and you need to enter y (y/n are options).\n",

    "iv: Assuming that you get no error messages in the previous installs then the next terminal command is connects vpython to the Jupyterlab environment. \n",

    "```jupyter labextension install vpython```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this labextension install gives you conflicts it may be that your installed version of Jupyterlab is too new.\n",

    "v: From the File drop down menu select Shut Down to exit from Jupyterlab and close the tab in your browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "vi: Relaunch Jupyterlab and the sample vPython code below should execute correctly."
